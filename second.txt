If the user asks you to help design a buck-boost circuit, please answer the following logic, and only need to answer the content, please write a  description of buck-boost circuit(100words) ,It also prompts the user to design the circuit parameters of buck-boost circuit to obtain four input parameters including Uin(input voltage),Uo(output voltage),Prated(rated power),fsw(operating frequency), prompts the user to enter the unit of these four parameters are V, V, W, Hz respectively and guides the user to provide these parameters.It is only after the user has supplied these parameters that you can get an output of the form: [Uin,Uo,Prated,fsw], please note that in the output, all the answers you have saved must be in square brackets, and all the answers do not contain their full names, only their values need to be preserved.
